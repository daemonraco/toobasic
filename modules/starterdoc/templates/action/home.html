## What is this page?
Well, you've just downloaded this framework and to give you some hints we
provided you with a starter module. If check the folder __ROOTDIR/modules__
you'll find a subfolder called __starterdoc__, just delete it or rename it to
**_starterdoc** and you'll have a complete empty site ot play with.

## Documentation

have some documentation and you can access pression this [link](README.md).
