# Basics
## What is this page?
Well, you've just downloaded this framework and to give you some hints we provided you with a starter module. If check the folder __ROOTDIR/modules__ you'll find a subfolder called __starterdoc__, just delete it or rename it to **_starterdoc** and you'll have a complete empty site ot play with.

## Documentation
Where can you find documentation? well, if you didn't removed it, you already have some documentation and you can access pression this [link](README.md).

## Basic Directory Structure
__TooBasic__ has a main list of directories that _must_ remain there:

* `cache`: Every dynamic content ends up here, things like pre-compiled PHPs, temporary thumbnails, etc.
* `config`: Main system configurations and definitions.
* `includes`: __TooBasic__ core logics are stored inside this folder.
* `libraries`: Here you can drop every library you project may require.
* `modules`: This folder is where plugins/modules are installed.
* `shell`: Shell tool's core logics are stored here.
* `site`: Site's customized controllers, views, scripts, etc.
