# TooBasic 0.1
## What is it?
Well __TooBasic__ is a too basic php framework with some basic features. Its main reason for existence is to provide a simple and quick framework in which you can start right away building your site while __TooBasic__ takes cake of some common stuff.

## Why would I use this at all?
Well, there's no real reason, you'll probably find much better solutions in the first page of a google search, but if you want to try a simple framework, keep reading.

## Basic Features?
__TooBasic__ provide some sort of solution to features like:

* __Services__: Controllers that only return a JSON result avoiding presentation logics.
* __Plugins (modules)__: A simple mechanism to expand your site through plugins
* __Shell Tools__: Some sites usually have background tools to perform heavy tasks, __TooBasic__ provides a way to define and manage this tools.
	* __Crons__: Something like tools but restricted to cron-type executions.
* __Cache__: It already has a simple way to cache controller result avoiding its logic on a second request (visit [Cache](docs/cache.md)).
* __Database Wrapping__: Provides a simple way access tables in a database by representation (visit [Databases](docs/databases.md)).

## Folders
__TooBasic__ has many folders and we're not going to list them all here, Just a few you may need to know.

* `ROOTDIR`
    * `site`: Mainly, all your site's stuff goes somewhere inside this folder.
        * `controllers`: Here you start all your PHP files with controller specifications.
        * `templates`: Here your store all your templates separated by the way you show them.
            * `action`: here you store the way your controllers are seen by default.
            * `modal`: and here the way your controllers are seen whem they are used as modals.
        * `config`: Specific configuration for your site goes here.
        * `models`: Well, this are a bunch of classes that represent your real site's logic. Remember, your controllers shouldn't have complex logics.
        * `langs`: Translations.
    * `modules`: Consider these as plugins.
    * `cache`: All the dynamic stuff of your site like cache files, smarty compilations, etc. will be stored here.

## How To Create A Basic Page
In order to create a basic page you need to create two files, a contorller and a template, and one name. 
The name must be a lower-case string without spaces or special characters (geeky info: `/([a-z0-9_]+)/`).

Why a name? well, this name will become the name of your action, your controller, your template and also the parameter to use in your browser, so, its an important name. For our examples we'll use __myaction__ as our _chosen one_.
### Controller
The controller will be a simple PHP class where you assign values to a set of names, trigger models calls and perform basic logics, etc.
Basically, this new controller will look like this:
```php
<?php
class MyactionController extends \TooBasic\Controller {
	protected function basicRun() {
		return true;
	}
}
```
Such class must be saved into a file called __myaction.php__ inside __ROOTDIR/site/controllers/__. Also, the class must be name based on the action name:
> Take your chosen name, change its first letter to upper-case and append __Controller__. Then inherit __Controller__ and define a protected method called __basicRun()__

Something to have in mind is to return _true_ or _false_ at the end of __basicRun()__. Why? well, __TooBasic__ uses this status to show errors and avoid features like _cache_.
### Template
Now that you have a controller, you need a template to specify the way you new action is seen when it's called. You may write something like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello World!</title>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h4>Hello World!</h4>
    </body>
</html>
```
Now you save this code into a file called __myaction.html__ inside __ROOTDIR/site/templates/action/__.
### Is That It?
Well, yes, that's all you need, now go to your browser, and enter your URL using the name of your action. somethin like this:
> http://www.example.com/?action=myaction

### But?
Ya ya ya, I know, this seems to be too complicated to build just a HTML, where is the magic? well, suppose your controller looks like this:
```php
<?php
class MyactionController extends \TooBasic\Controller {
    protected $_cached = true;
	protected function basicRun() {
	    $this->assign("hello", "Hello World!");
		return true;
	}
}
```
And your template looks like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{$hello}</title>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h4>{$hello}</h4>
    </body>
</html>
```
The result may be the same, but now you are using names previously set in your controller and also you're saving a cache file of what you've seen in your browser (for an hour), so the next time you refresh your page, the method __basicRun()__ won't be called, its logic won't be used and a cached result will be returned.

Also, you may create a file called __en_us.json__ inside __ROOTDIR/site/langs/__ with something like:
```json
{
	"keys": [
		{
			"key": "hello",
			"value": "Hello World!"
		}
	]
}
```
Modify your controller:
```php
<?php
class MyactionController extends \TooBasic\Controller {
    protected function basicRun() {
	    $this->assign("hello", $this->translate->hello);
		return true;
	}
}
```
And your template:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{$hello}</title>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h4>{$tr->hello}</h4>
    </body>
</html>
```
Now you're also using translations, both inside your template and your controller.

## Smarty
![Alt:smarty](http://www.smarty.net/images/icons/smarty-80x15.png)

Even though you can use other mechanisms, __TooBasic__ provides and adapter for templace using [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/) as engine, and it's selected by default. Therefore, you should visit its documentation at [smarty.net Documentation](http://www.smarty.net/documentation).

Of course, if you want to use a different template interpreter, you may visit the [Adapters Doc](docs/adapters.md) to find an alternative.
