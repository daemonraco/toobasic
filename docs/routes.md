# TooBasic: Routes
## What are routes?
Oh yes, routes, some pretty stuff and clean way to browse your site, but also a
heavy matter when it comes to explain _what_ it is and _how_ it works, so, to
avoid misunderstanding and outdated terminology, let's allow the community to
explain it for us and follow these links:

* [Semantic URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL)
* [Rewrite Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_engine)

Perhaps too much to read and not that much understanding, well let's say you have
this complex and ugly URL here:

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/?action=product&id=204578&view_mode=clean&expand=description

_Routes_ allows you to use it in cleaner way like this:

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/product/cleaned/204578?expand=description

## Before we start
Hold your horses!
Before we start there are a bunch of things you need to check to be sure you can
use routes.

### mod_rewrite
Check your _Apache_ configuration (here we suppose you're using
[_Apache_](http://httpd.apache.org/)) and make sure you are loading the module
__mod_rewrite__.
If your are not sure how to check that, write a simple php file in your site
having this code an access it:
```php
<?php
phpinfo();
```
When you access it through browser, look for a section called __Loaded Modules__
and check if it includes __mod_rewrite__.
If not, follow
[this link](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html) and you may
find some help in how to solve this issue.

Also, if you have __TooBasic__ up and running you can use the debug parameter
`?debugphpinfo` and it will show you such information.

### Allow override
Check you _Apache_ configuration file (probably at __/etc/apache2/apache2.conf__
on *nix systems).
Inside it look for something looking like this:
```
<Directory /var/www/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
</Directory>
```
And make sure that `AllowOverride` is set to `All`.

If you're not sure about the security of this step, you may add something like
this instead:
```
<Directory /var/www/mysite/>
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
</Directory>
```

### Permissions
Make sure your web user has reading permission for the __.htaccess__ file.

### The right name
To avoid assuming a default name that may be wrong, check you _Apache_
configuration file and look for the tag __AccessFileName__, if it's not
__.htaccess__ you have to take one of these options:

* Rename __.htaccess__ file to match this configuration (recommended).
* Change the _Apache_ configuration (here I hope you know what you are doing).

## Activating routes
By default, __TooBasic__ assumes you're not using clean URLs, therefore the first
step to take is to activate them.
Go to your site's main configuration file located at __ROOTDIR/site/config.php__
and add something like this:
```php
<?php
$Defaults[GC_DEFAULTS_ALLOW_ROUTES] = true;
```
This will change many internal behaviors and it will start analyzing routes
configurations and checking for a URL parameter called __route__.

## Our first route
Let's think about the URL we mentioned at the beginning of this page and use it as
our example:

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/?action=product&id=204578&view_mode=clean&expand=description

If we look closely we can find three important parts:

* `action`: The action/controller to invoke, in this case, a controller to display
a product.
* `id`: The id of a product to display.
* `view_mode`: The way a product has to be displayed.

Based on this, we may want to transform this URL into something simpler, something
like our example:

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/product/cleaned/204578?expand=description

Where:

* `product`: Is a short access for `action=product`.
* `cleaned`: Short for `view_mode=clean`.
* `204578`: Short for `id=204578`.

To achieve this we are going to write a file at
__ROOTDIR/site/configs/routes.json__ with something like this:
```json
{
    "routes": [{
        "route": "product/cleaned/:id:int",
        "action": "product",
        "params": {"view_mode": "clean"}
    }]
}
```

_Now, what the heck is going on here?_
First thing you need to know is that every route specification has two important
parameters __route__ and __action__, in other words, the way the URL looks like
and the action/controller that is going to take care of it.

The parameters `params` is a way to implicitly set URL parameters, in our case,
when this route is valid it will assume there's a URL parameter called
__view_mode__ with the value _clean_.

## Route analysis
Ok, we've seen how to configure a route, but, how does the __route__ pattern work?
Well the first thing you need to know is that __TooBasic__ splits this value on
each slash (`/`) and checks each piece against the current URL, also split in the
same manner.

First two pieces, `product` and `cleaned` are considered to be _literal_ which
means they must be exact matches.
The third piece is a little more tricky and it's considered a _parameter_.

Now, a _parameter_ is not a piece of URL that has to be check, in fact is a piece
that has to be transformed into a URL query's parameter.
In our example, when we say `:id:` we are saying the piece is a parameter (that's
the meaning of those colons) and it's name will be __id__.
Also we are adding a type check saying `:id:int`, which means it is a parameter
called __id__ and it must be an integer.

### Parameters types
When validating parameters types, you may use this:

* `string` or `str`: for string values.
* `integer` or `int`: for numeric values.
* `enum`: validation against a list of possible values.
* nothing: for no validation.

### Let's write a few more
Let's use those things we've said and write something like this:
```json
{
    "routes": [{
        "route": "product/cleaned/:id:int",
        "action": "product",
        "params": {"view_mode": "clean"}
    },{
        "route": "product/:view_mode:enum:clean,compact,full/:id:int",
        "action": "product"
    },{
        "route": "product/:id:int",
        "action": "product",
        "params": {"view_mode": "clean"}
    },{
        "route": "product",
        "action": "products"
    },{
        "route": "products",
        "action": "products"
    }]
}
```
Here is a bunch of valid URL for these routes:

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/product/cleaned/204578?expand=description

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/product/clean/204578?expand=description

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/product/full/204578

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/product/compact/204578

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/product

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/products

## Url issues
All this may look interesting, clean and fun, but there are a few aspects that can
give you a headache.
Let's say you have a layout looking like this (in Smarty):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>MySite</title>
		<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="site/images/favicon.ico"/>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="site/styles/main.css"/>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a class="HelpButton" href="?action=helpme" target="_blank">Help Me Please!</a>
		<div class="MainContent container">
%TOO_BASIC_ACTION_CONTENT%
		</div>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="libraries/angularjs/angular.min.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="site/scripts/main.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```
When you use route you may end up having HTTP-404 errors every where looking for
things like:

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/product/cleaned/204578/site/images/favicon.ico

When it should be:

>http://www.myhost.com/mysite/site/images/favicon.ico

And you shouldn't use something like this:
```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="/mysite/site/images/favicon.ico"/>
```
Because you'll never know where your site will be deployed, so __/mysite__ is a
directory name that may change.

Here is where _controller exports_ come in handy.
Let's rewrite this layout in this way:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>MySite</title>
		<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="{$ctrl->img('favicon','ico')}"/>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{$ctrl->css('main')}"/>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a class="HelpButton" href="{$ctrl->link('?action=helpme')}" target="_blank">Help Me Please!</a>
		<div class="MainContent container">
%TOO_BASIC_ACTION_CONTENT%
		</div>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="{$ctrl->lib('angularjs/angular.min.js')}"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="{$ctrl->js('main')}"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```
In this way, we are letting __TooBasic__ take care of many of our URLs trusting
that it will add the write prefix to avoid problems.

### Final result
After rendering, our layout may look like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>MySite</title>
		<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="/mysite/site/images/favicon.ico"/>
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/mysite/site/styles/main.css"/>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a class="HelpButton" href="/mysite/?action=helpme" target="_blank">Help Me Please!</a>
		<div class="MainContent container">
%TOO_BASIC_ACTION_CONTENT%
		</div>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/mysite/libraries/angularjs/angular.min.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/mysite/site/scripts/main.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

## Modules?
Yes, each module may add a __routes.json__ file inside its __configs__ directory
and it will be loaded.

## Services
Services can also specify routes and they are very much the same with only one
difference, instead of setting the parameter `action` you should use `service` and
it will assume `?service=...` instead of  `?action=...`.
