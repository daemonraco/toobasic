# TooBasic: Modules
## What are modules?
Modules are plugins, in other words, modules are a small set of codes that can be
added to your site providing some specific functionality.
Sometimes they are a bunch of controllers, maybe the views of certain skin or even
single file for an specific _model_.

To keep it simple, let's say each module acts in the same way that your folder
`ROOTDIR/site`.
In fact, aside of one or two files, it shares the same structure.
