# TooBasic: Database Structure Specifications
## What is this?
_Database Structure Specifications_ is mechanism used by __TooBasic__ to specify
how one or more databases used by a site should look like.
For example, if your site has users, you probably have a table where you store
your users, their authentication information, their emails, etc.
If that's the case, __TooBasic__ provides a way to specify such table, its fields
and indexes, and based on it, keep it always healthy.

Why would you care to write a rather long JSON file when you can manage your
database directly? well, it's not completely necessary that you use this mechanism
on your site, but if you do, you know that if a table index or column gets removed
by accident, __TooBasic__ will re-create it (nonetheless data will be lost in most
cases).

What can you specify? __TooBasic__ provides a way to specify four things we're
going to explain later on:

* Cross database basic configurations
* Tables structures
* Indexes
* Initial table data

## Cross database basic configurations
As you're already guessing from the title, these are very specific parameters that
affect all your database specifications.
Anyway, don't be afraid, they are not so many and __TooBasic__ already has them
with default values.

If you open the file __ROOTDIR/config/dbspecs.json__ you'll find something like
this:
```json
{
	"configs": {
		"prefixes": {
			"index": "idx_",
			"key": "unq_",
			"primary": "pk_"
		}
	}
}
```

`configs` indicates what you are trying to specify and the only thing it supports
right now are index prefixes for:

* indexes with unique values (`key`).
* indexes with duplicated values (`index`).
* primary keys (`primary`).

This file is included before any other specification which means you can write
your own in, for example, __ROOTDIR/site/db/myspec.json__ and override those
__TooBasic__ defaults.

Here you have to take something in consideration, the section `configs` is always
overridden when another specification file has such section and only the last will
survive.
Be careful with every specification section because each one has its own
overriding policy.

## Tables structures
This is the main section of _database structure specifications_ and may look like
this:
```json
{
	"tables" : [{
		"connection": "seconddb",
		"name": "users",
		"prefix": "usr_",
		"fields": [{
			"name": "id",
			"type": {
				"type": "int",
				"precision": 11
			},
			"autoincrement": true
		}, {
			"name": "username",
			"type": {
				"type": "varchar",
				"precision": 32
			},
			"autoincrement": false
		}, {
			"name": "password",
			"type": {
				"type": "varchar",
				"precision": 50
			}
		}]
	}]
}
```

What's this?! let's explain it.
First of all, `tables` is a list of specification object representing each table,
but you already got that.
Each table has three mandatory fields you should never forget:

* `name`: The table name without prefixes. Prefixes will be added later depending
on the connection used.
* `prefix`: This is the general prefix to prepend on each field name.
* `fields`: The list of table fields/columns with their own specs.

You may also give these fields:

* `connection`: The name of the database connection through which a table should
be maintained.
	* When _null_ or not given, it takes the default connection (read more
	about it in further sections).
* `comment`: Table description text.
* `engine`: The engine to use with a table, for example __myisam__. But, this is
useless if your not using _MySQL_.

### Fields
Each table field/column has its own list of mandatory fields:

* `name`: Column name without prefixes. Relax and write the name as you know it
and let the system add the prefix later.
* `type`: Column type specification (read more about it below).

And you may also give these:

* `null`: This is a boolean field and configures a column to accept null values or
not. When not present, it's assumed false.
* `autoincrement`: This is a boolean field and it indicates if current column
increments its value automatically.
	* This also means this is a primary key field.
	* When not given it's assumed false.
* `comment`: Column description text.
* `default`: 

### Column type
Column types have their own specification mechanism with this fields:

* `type`<sup>mandatory</sup>: The type it self.
	* _blob_
		* `precision` may be _false_.
	* _enum_
	* _float_
	* _int_
	* _text_
	* _timestamp_
		* `precision` may be _false_.
	* _varchar_
* `precision`<sup>mandatory when type is not _enum_</sup>: Indicates how log a
field is.
* `values`<sup>mandatory when type is _enum_</sup>: List of values to be used by a
enumerative field.

### Override policy
The override policy for tables is to replace everything, except `fields`.
`fields` has a different behavior where every field is appended, unless it's
duplicated.
This allows you to specify a table for your site while a module adds some extra
fields to the same table without the need to redefine the entire table.

## Indexes
As expected, you can specify what indexes have to be there in your database and
such specification may look like this:
```json
{
	"indexes": [{
		"name": "username",
		"table": "users",
		"type": "key",
		"fields": ["username"]
	}]
}
```

Each index has four mandatory fields:

* `name`: Index name.
* `table`: Name of the table on which to create the index. This name has to be
without prefix.
* `type`: Index type:
	* _key_
	* _index_
	* _primary_
* `fields`: List of columns name to use. Each name has to be without prefix.

And some not mandatory:

* `connection`: The name of the database connection through which an index should
be maintained.
	* When _null_ or not given, it takes the default connection (read more
	about it in further sections).

Something to have in mind is that after every _database structure specification_
is loaded, if an index specification points to a non specified table, it will be
ignored.

### Override policy
When an index is specified more than once, the last one survives.

## Initial table data
Let's suppose you database represents some kind of items and those items have a
_status_ indicated with a numeric id.
If your site is polite enough, you'll have a table of statuses in which you
associate that with a displayable name and a description.

Something you'll probably want to ensure is that your system always has some basic
statuses, for example these:

| sts_id | sts_name | sts_description              |
|:------:|:--------:|:-----------------------------|
|   1    | New      | Newly created item.          |
|   2    | Working  | The item is being processed. |
|   3    | Done     | Item's tasks are completed.  |

Assuming __sts_id__ is a primary key of such table, you may write an specification
like this one:
```json
{
	"data": [{
		"table": "statuses",
		"checkfields": ["id"],
		"entries": [{
			"id": 1,
			"name": "New",
			"description": "Newly created item."
		},{
			"id": 2,
			"name": "Working",
			"description": "The item is being processed."
		}, {
			"id": 3,
			"name": "Done",
			"description": "Item's tasks are completed."
		}]
	}]
}
```

Now what's going on here? As you can see, every element inside `entries` is a row
specification and every column name is given without its prefix because that will
depend on its table.

But what is `checkfields`? This specification is a maintenance specification,
which means it must check if an entry exists and insert it when it doesn't.
`checkfields` is the list of columns to use when checking if an entry is already
there.
In our example, we know __sts_id__ is a primary key, so we assume that searching
entries by their *id*s would be enough.

The rest is:

* `table`: for the table name. Mandatory and without prefixes.
* `connection`: To optionaly specify a database connection to use.

### Policies
A few policies to have in mind:

* The _overriding policy_ for data specification is to append all new entries and
replace those that were already given.
* If some data specification points to an unknown table it will be ignored.

## Connections
We've been talking about a configuration field called `connection` for some time
now but we haven't talked much about its real purpose, so let's talk.

Let's say you have a complex site that uses more than one database and two or more
of them have a table called 'users', each one with a different structure and
equally important so you want to specify them in your _database structure
specification_.
This configuration field will allow you to separate each table specification for
the right connection.
Also when you specify an index or some initial data, it will point to the right
connection and table too.

### Default connection
How about that default connection we name somewhere above? As you may expect, the
default connection is that one you name in
`$Connections[GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS][GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS_DB]`.
But in some cases you may want to have a connection to access your default
database with only DML access permissions and another connection for DDL
operations, if that's the case, you may use the configuration field `connection`
or simple set its name in
`$Connections[GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS][GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS_INSTALL]`.

## Unknowns
This database maintenance mechanism is rather violent and it might destroy unknown
tables, columns and indexes (data is always ketp as it is) and only let live those
inside the _database structure specification_.
To avoid such trouble, you may set
`$Connections[GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS][GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS_KEEPUNKNOWNS]` to
_true_ and no drop will be run.

## Performance
Yes _performance_ is an issue here, all these checks will eat your system and make
everything slower, but we encourage you to use it because it will keep your
databases healthy and basically because you can turn it off and temporarily back
on again when you install a new module or when you have the feeling that something
went wrong inside your databases.
