# TooBasic: Forms Builder
## What is Forms Builder?
_Forms Builder_ is an internal mechanism of __TooBasic__ that allows to specify
HTML forms a JSON configuration.
The main idea in it is to create single specification for certain form and be able
to show it in more than one mode.

For example, if create a form to display an item in the database, other to edit
it, other when you have to remove it and another to create a new item, the first
thing you'll notice is that it is the same form where the only change is it's
behavior and maybe how many buttons it has at the end.
For those cases, _Forms Builder_ provides a way to specify fields once and some
specific properties depending on how the form should be built.
