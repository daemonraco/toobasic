# TooBasic: Cache
## We All Know What It Is
True, we all know what a [cache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_%28computing%29) system is, the real question is *what does __TooBasic__ have to say about it?*

## What is it cached?
Internally, __TooBasic__ separates the stuff it caches in two kinds:

* __Computing Cache__: This can also be called _controller cache_ because it stores all the assignments made by a controller.
* __View Cache__: You can see this as a HTML cache where you store the final result of rendering a controller call.

Why is it separated? well, if recall a cache controller but requesting a different format, you wouldn't want to run all your logics and queries and etc. when you only need a different format.

## Adapters
From factory, __TooBasic__ provides three types of cache adaptations you can choose on for your site and we are going to describe them.

### File Cache Adapter
The most basic (and default) cache adapter provided by __TooBasic__ is a class called __\TooBasic\CacheAdapterFile__ and it stores data inside a files. When active, you'll find files coming and going inside __ROOTDIR/cache/filecache__.

### Database Cache Adapter
A not very polite way of caching data is store it inside a database, but in some cases it could be useful.
For those cases, __TooBasic__ provides an abstract adapter class called __\TooBasic\CacheAdapterDB__ and a specification for __MySQL__ called __\TooBasic\CacheAdapterDBMySQL__.
This adapter makes use of a table called __cache__ (if there's a table prefix it will use it) inside the database configured in `$Connections[GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS][GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS_CACHE]` (or `$Connections[GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS][GC_CONNECTIONS_DEFAUTLS_DB]` if none) and its structure will be created with a query like the next one (if __MySQL__):
```sql
create table if not exists cache (
        cch_key  varchar(256) collate utf8_bin not null,
        cch_data blob not null,
        cch_date timestamp not null default current_timestamp,
        primary key(cch_key)
) engine=myisam default charset=utf8 collate=utf8_bin
```
By default, __TooBasic__ will attempt to create this table every time it's invoked, if you want to avoid this behavior you can set the global `$Defaults[GC_DEFAULTS_INSTALLED]` to `true`.

### Memcached Adapter
A better approach is to use something like [__Memcached__](http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php) where you can store data in memory inside a cache service prepared for that task.
For this, __TooBasic__ provides a cache adapter class called __\TooBasic\CacheAdapterMemcached__ and it requires settings like these:
```php
<?php
$Defaults[GC_DEFAULTS_MEMCACHED][GC_DEFAULTS_MEMCACHED_SERVER] = "localhost";
$Defaults[GC_DEFAULTS_MEMCACHED][GC_DEFAULTS_MEMCACHED_PORT] = 11211;
$Defaults[GC_DEFAULTS_MEMCACHED][GC_DEFAULTS_MEMCACHED_PREFIX] = "";
```
If you are wondering about `$Defaults[GC_DEFAULTS_MEMCACHED][GC_DEFAULTS_MEMCACHED_PREFIX]`, well when you have more than one __TooBasic__ based site using the same __Memcached__ service, you may find some collision problems and this global allows you to tag each cache key with a prefix depending on your site.

## Setting Adapter
We've been talking about cache adapter classes but we haven't said how to use them, well, that's the easy part, you just need to set something like the next piece of code and that's all:
```php
<?php
$Defaults[GC_DEFAULTS_CACHE_ADAPTER] = "\TooBasic\CacheAdapterMemcached";
```

## Cached Controller
Now that you know all this about __TooBasic__'s cache system, you need to know how to configure it for your controller. Once again, let's use a simple example, suppose we have a controller that shows a user information... something like this:
```php
<?php
class UserinfoController extends \TooBasic\Controller {
    protected function basicRun() {
        $user = $this->representations->users->item($this->params->get->userid);
        $this->assign("info", $user->toArray());
        $this->assign("bgcolor", isset($this->params->get->bgcolor) ? $this->params->get->bgcolor : "red");
        return true;
    }
    protected function init() {
        parent::init();
        $this->_requiredParams["GET"][] = "userid";
    }
}
```
Now, let's say we want to cache this controller's called based on the _user ID_ and a parameter called _bgcolor_. For that we need to do two things:

* First, we need to activate the use of cache:
```php
<?php
class UserinfoController extends \TooBasic\Controller {
    protected $_cache = true;
    . . .
}
```
* And second we need to specify which parameters to take in consideration when generating a cache key:
```php
<?php
class UserinfoController extends \TooBasic\Controller {
    . . .
    protected function init() {
        . . . 
        $this->_cacheParams["GET"][] = "userid";
        $this->_cacheParams["GET"][] = "bgcolor";
        . . . 
    }
}
```

All together will look like this:

```php
<?php
class UserinfoController extends \TooBasic\Controller {
    protected $_cache = true;
    protected function basicRun() {
        $user = $this->representations->users->item($this->params->get->userid);
        $this->assign("info", $user->toArray());
        $this->assign("bgcolor", isset($this->params->get->bgcolor) ? $this->params->get->bgcolor : "red");
        return true;
    }
    protected function init() {
        parent::init();
        $this->_cacheParams["GET"][] = "userid";
        $this->_cacheParams["GET"][] = "bgcolor";
        $this->_requiredParams["GET"][] = "userid";
    }
}
```
And that's it, from now on, our controller saves cache entries and calls like these will have different entries:

* http://www.example.com/?action=userinfo&userid=10&bgcolor=green
* http://www.example.com/?action=userinfo&userid=10&bgcolor=blue
* http://www.example.com/?action=userinfo&userid=12&bgcolor=green
* http://www.example.com/?action=userinfo&userid=10

What about the last one? well, if you don't pass a parameter called _bgcolor_ it will consider it as empty and generate a different key.

## What if you don't want it?
Yes, what if you don't want any cache system and the use of `&debugresetcache` in the url annoys you?
Well, there's an adapter called __CacheAdapterNoCache__ that acts as a dummy providing you with the solution.
It will interact as any other cache adapter but it won't do a thing and you'll be working without cache.
