# TooBasic: Author's Note
Well hi there, my name is Alejandro and I'm cyberly known as [DAEMon
Raco](http://www.daemonraco.com).
In this page I'll talk about __TooBasic__ and my motivations to create it and I'll
try to give some explanations to things you may be wondering... maybe not.

## TooBasic?!
Yes, the name is __TooBasic__, why? well, when I started I wanted to create a
simple framework I could paste somewhere in a _xampp_ or _Apache_ folder and start
typing some logic right away without the need to worry about _how I read the
current class to use from the url_.

In manner of speaking I still think and feel that's the goal of this framework,
but if your read a little more about it you'll see it's not that _basic_.
Perhaps, in some point I had to ask my self _"Am I going too far for a basic
framework?"_, but I've never asked me that because all the stuff I'm adding are
things I want to have in my reach and in the reach of anyone who uses it
regardless of the goal of a site running over __TooBasic__.
I'll never know if I'll use this framework to display a simple welcome page at
some URL, a blog, a forum or even a social network, so I need to keep an open mind
and think that someday me or someone may want to use _Memcached_ instead of
_Redis_, or _SQLite_ instead of _MySQL_, or simply create a plugin to change the
skin of a welcome page.

It is too basic in a way, you create a small class in a specific place and that is
a service with an interface and a basic JSON response.
You set an instance variable to `true` and its response will be cached for an
hour, just like that.
But I'll agree if someone says _it's not that basic_.

## One action one controller?!
Yes, the answer is as plain and simple as that.
That's because this topic will be like the decision of placing a curly brace in
the same line or the next when you write an `if` sentence (python doesn't apply).
Anyway, I'll try to give some explanation on why I do this.

In my experience I've seen developers writing some not-so-simple logic inside a
controller's action, but they are smart enough to place the complex logic inside a
protected/private method inside that controller.
Then they need a new action and they create a new method for that action inside
the same controller.
Let's assume here both actions are related to the same _meaning_ managed by that
controller, otherwise we have nothing else to discuss.
Due to the smart move previously made, this new action can use that complex logic
and with a few touches the developer has a new action up and running.

Time passes and a wild new controller appears and it requires that same old
complex logic.
But come on, we can not duplicate code, that would be ugly, so the programmer
takes a ton of metallic grey duct tape and tucks them together so tightly they
start sharing that complex logic... NOOOOO!!!... cof... cof, let me... let me calm
down a little, I'll just take this jerrycan of gasoline AND BURN THE CODE TO
ASHES!!!

_Wait!, calm down, what is the problem?_

Well, it's WRONG!, wrong from the beginning, that complex logic is shouting for
its own place to live and be visited by those controllers.
That complex logic MUST be part of a model.
Believe me, there will be a third controller asking for that logic and for that
time there's gonna be so much duck tape and dust they'll need a paleontologist to
dig that piece of code out of there.

This kind of situations are those I want to mitigate by having separated
classes/controllers for each action.
At least this way, that programmer will think twice about putting that logic
somewhere else.

_But... what about shell tools?_

Enough!, let's change the topic already.
